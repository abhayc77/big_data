## Specific instructions

Specific instructions to complete this assignment are available [here](./ASSIGNMENT.md).

## Grading


1. Clone the latest release of your forked GitHub repository.
2. Source the `env.sh` script: `source answers/env.sh`. Feel free to add any setup step to this script (e.g. if your solution requires environment variables).
3. Install any dependency with `pip install -r requirements.txt --user`.
4. Run `pytest`.

Your grade will be determined from the number of passing tests as
returned by pytest. For instance, if 11 tests have passed out of 13,
your grade will be 84.6%.

You may want to run `pytest` in your fork to check the tests beforehand. To do that, you will have to install `pytest` using `pip install --user pytest ; setenv PATH ${PATH}:${HOME}/.local/bin`
