Clone the latest release of your forked GitHub repository.
Source the env.sh script: source answers/env.sh. Feel free to add any setup step to this script (e.g. if your solution requires environment variables).
Install any dependency with pip install -r requirements.txt --user.
Add undisclosed tests to directory test.
Run pytest.
Your grade will be determined from the number of passing tests as returned by pytest. For instance, if 11 tests have passed out of 13, your grade will be 84.6%.
